                        institutions, associations and private individuals.

                        areas. This enables us to learn valuable skills in the areas of project organization,
                        implementation, presentation, financing and public relations. These are also valuable skills for
                        future careers, which make iGEM participants stand out from the crowd. Since iGEM is an
                        international competition, new national and international contacts are established through
                        cultural
                        exchange. We welcome and invite students from all backgrounds and take pride in our very
                        interdisciplinary and diverse team.
                        Experienced researchers play a vital role in the project development and planning stage.
